# Monty Interpreter

> Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the ``` C ``` language and is compliant with `ISO90`, `ISO99`, & `ISO11`. It reads `Monty` bytecode files of any extension (preferably `.m` although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.
>
> This interpreter can be run as either a stack (`LIFO`) or queue (`FIFO`). Mode can be switched mid-script. The interpreter can handle a variety of Monty opcodes, including printing, mathematical operations, and more - all handled opcodes are listed below.
